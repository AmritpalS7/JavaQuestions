    "explanation":"The correct answer is 1,3,6,8,9,12,26,54. To do an inorder traversal we visit the left node, the root node, then the right node"},

    "correctAnswer":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/ImageAsAnswer2_1.PNG",
    "explanation":"The first image is correct. 10%6=4, 12%6=0, 2%6=2 and 22%6=4. We enter 10,12 and 2 in their respective positions. Then using linear probing, since a collision occurs, we put 22 in the next availabnle position which is 5"},
 { "id":"11",
    "qType":"tf",
    "qText":"In Java you can change the size of an array after creation",
    "correctAnswer":"false",
    "options":["true","false"],
    "explanation":"In Java, once an array is created, you can not change its size"},

    "options":["!(5 * 5 == 25)","3 + 3 == 5","7 + 2 > 4 + 2", "50%3==1"],
    "explanation":"7 + 2 > 4 + 2 would return true. Java would evaluate both sides of the expression then compare them. 9>6, so it would return true"},
  { "id":"13",
    "qType":"ti",
    "qText":"What is the syntax you would use to print out 'Hello World!' in a line? (include ; and use '' instead of quotes, bc of JSON object constraints)",
    "correctAnswer": "System.out.println('Hello World!');",
    "explanation":"We use System.out.println('Hello World!'); to print out Hello World! in a line in Java"},
 { "id":"14",

    "qText":"What would be the output of the following code snippet?",
    "imageSource":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/imageThenAnswer3.PNG",
    "correctAnswer":"[e, a, b, c]",
    "options":["[a, b, c, d]","[e, a, b, d]","[a, b, c, d, e]","[e, a, b, c]"],
    "explanation":"The correct answer is [e, a, b, c]. We enter a,b,d,c in order. When we add e at position 0, the ArrayList becomes e,a,b,d,c. Then we remove the String at position 3, thus the final array is e,a,b,c"},
 { "id":"15",
    "qType":"iaa",
    "qText":"If you were to create an empty AVL tree and insert 6,8,12,14,1,9,2 with 6 being the initial root node, what would the final tree look like?",
    "imageSources":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/ImageAsAnswer3_1.PNG","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/ImageAsAnswer3_2.PNG"],
    "correctAnswer":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/ImageAsAnswer3_2.PNG",
    "explanation":"The second image is correct. An AVL tree autobalances, with a balance condition of 1 (unless otherwise specified). Once we enter 6,8,12, the tree becomes unbalanced so we rebalance with 8 becoming the root node, not 6 as in image 1"},
  { "id":"16",
    "qType":"tf",
    "qText":"In Java your class always has a constructor?",
    "correctAnswer":"true",
    "options":["true","false"],
    "explanation":"In Java, even if you do not declare it, there is an implicit default constructor"},
 { "id":"17",
    "qType":"mc",
    "qText":"How do you check how many elements an ArrayList has in Java?",
    "correctAnswer":".size()",
    "options":[".scope()",".charCount()",".size()", ".length()"],
    "explanation":"We use .size() to find out how many elements an ArrayList contains"},
 { "id":"18",
    "qType":"ti",
    "qText":"Fill in the blank such that you create an integer, a with value 10: ____ a =10;",
    "correctAnswer": "int",
    "explanation":"To declare an integer in Java, we use the int keyword"},
{ "id":"19",
    "qType":"ita",
    "qText":"What is the big O time complexity of the following code snippet?",
    "imageSource":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/imageThenAnswer4.PNG",
    "correctAnswer":"O(n^2)",
    "options":["O(n)","O(n^2)","O(nlogn)","O(1)"],
    "explanation":"The correct answer is O(n^2). The first loop has a nested loop and we are incrementing i and j by 1, so it has a time complexity of O(n^2). The second loop similarly increments i by 1, but there is no loop so it has a time complexity of O(n). The bigger term is O(n^2), making it the time complexity of the snippet"},
 { "id":"20",
    "qType":"iaa",
    "qText":"Which of the following two images is a heap?",

    "correctAnswer":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritpalS7/CUS1172/main/Project3/images/javaQuiz/ImageAsAnswer4_1.PNG",
    "explanation":"The first image is correct. A binary min heap, has to be a complete binary tree, with any extra leaves being left to right. Both trees satisfy the order property (children are greater than their parents), however the tree in the seconf image has the extra leaf on the right side"}
